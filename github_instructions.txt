# Instructions for pushing your code to GitHub

Since we're having issues with Git authentication through Replit, here's how to push your code from your local machine:

## Option 1: Download the ZIP and push from your computer

1. Download the "st-louis-dryer-vent-cleaning.zip" file that was created
2. Extract the ZIP file on your local computer
3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the extracted folder
4. Run these commands:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/chrishamcode/st-louis-dryer-vent-cleaning.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Clone the empty repository and add files

1. Clone your empty GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrishamcode/st-louis-dryer-vent-cleaning.git
cd st-louis-dryer-vent-cleaning
```

2. Download the ZIP file from Replit
3. Extract the contents into your cloned repository folder
4. Add, commit, and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

This will push all the code to your GitHub repository.
